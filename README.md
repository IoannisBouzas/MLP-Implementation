# MLP-Implementation

For this problem first i had to construct datasets for a four-category classification problem. The goal is to generate 8000 examples within the square [-1,1]x[-1,1], with 4000 examples for the training set and 4000 for the control set. Each example (x1, x2) is ranked into one of four categories based on certain conditions. I had to implement a classification program (PT) using a multilevel perceptron (MLP) with three hidden levels. The program consists of several modules, including specifying the number of inputs, classes, neurons in each hidden layer, and the activation function. It also involves loading and encoding the datasets, defining the MLP network architecture, implementing the forward-pass and backpropagation functions, and training the network using the gradient descent algorithm. The program terminates when the training error difference between two epochs is below a threshold. After training, the program calculates and prints the generalization capacity of the network, which is the percentage of correct decisions in the control set. The PT program is then used to study the classification problem of SDT, where the generalization ability of the network is explored by considering different combinations of hidden layer sizes, activation functions, and batch sizes. The network with the best generalizability is identified, and the examples in the control set are printed using different styles to indicate correct or incorrect classification by the network.
